How do I get the Google Calendar feed address? 
1. Open your Google Calendar and on the left side bar click "My calendars" which should list all of your calendars.
2. To the right of your calendar name is a dropdown indicator; click it and a dialog will display.
3. Click "Clendar settings" and that will open a page with all of your calendar settings on it.
4. Towards the bottom are a set of three buttons XML(orange) ICAL(green) HTML(blue). Click the XML(orange) and a dialog will open displaying the link to the calendar.
